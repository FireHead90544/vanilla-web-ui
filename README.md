## Vanilla Web UIs

Collection of some UIs I wrote while learning/teaching/practicing web related stuffs.

### Not really important things to note

- Everything inside `archived/not-mine` is not mine as the name suggests, just followed along some tuts in the past. Rest is genuine shit :)
- Free to use, just [do what the f*ck you want to](https://github.com/FireHead90544/vanilla-web-ui/blob/master/LICENSE)
